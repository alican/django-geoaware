How to use
=================


Include 'geoware' in your `INSTALLED_APPS` somewhere after `'django.contrib.gis'`.

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'some apps go here',
        'django.contrib.gis',
        'some other apps can go here',
        'geoaware',
        'some other apps can go here',
    ]

To include GeoIP related info in the session:
    
    Include geoaware middleware in your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` after the session middleware.
    
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
    'some middleware can go here',
    'geoaware.middleware.GeoSessionMiddleware',
    'some more middleware can go here',
    ] 

    The GeoIP related info would be available in request.session['geo_info']


To include GeoIP related info in the context:
    
    Include geoware context processor in your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` after `'django.core.context_processors.request'`.
    
    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = [
        'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
        'some context processor can go here',
        'django.core.context_processors.request',
        'some context processor can go here',
        'geoaware.context_processors.geoaware',
        'some context processor can go here',
    ]

    The GeoIP related info would be available in your context as geo_info.


To access the GeoIP data:

   Note that geo_info is a dictionary that includes the following:
 
   ```python
   geo_info = {
        'fqdn_or_ip': '',
        'city': '', 
        'continent_code': '', 
        'region': '',
        'charset': 0,
        'area_code': 0,
        'longitude': 0.0,
        'country_code3': '',
        'latitude': 0.0,
        'postal_code': None,
        'dma_code': 0,
        'country_code': '',
        'country_name': '',
    }
    ```

    If some fields are not available they are left unpopulated.
